Sleuthin' : a mystery solving social network

Have you ever wondered what little mysteries people run into on a daily basis? From, something as simple as missing keys to something as huge as a stolen car, 
people run into new mysterues every day. That's why I created Sleuthin': a mystery solving social network. It was inspired by video games such as persona 5 where
there were websites in the game that people posted mysteries / cases for the main characters to solve. The stack used to create the app was express js, apollo server, 
mongoDB, react, and react router.
